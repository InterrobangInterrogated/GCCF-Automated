# GCCF-Automated
A utility I made that automates the installation process of https://github.com/solsticegamestudios/GModCEFCodecFix

# How to use
To use this, you MUST:
- have GMod installed (obviously)
- have Python installed, and if you don't have it, get it at https://www.python.org/downloads
- have Git installed, and if you don't have it, get it at https://git-scm.com/downloads
- be running Windows (I don't have a computer with GMod that uses Linux, sorry)

1. Download the gmodcefcodecfix.bat file and place it in your user directory (usually C:\Users\(insert username here)
2. Run it
3. Let the magic happen
4. Boom, you're done
